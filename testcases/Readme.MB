# All pull-requests will be put here in testing in some form. The maintainers will throughly test your code, and then contact you to deny or accept your pull request 
Sometimes your code might work, but does not meet our standards. In this case, we will let you know what you need to do to fix it.
If your pull request passes the maintainers will work on pushing your code to production.  We typically push code that passes to production every Sunday. 
Do not worry your code will have a comment above it that will acknowledge your name and username, and your contribution and will help this product.
If you wish to opt out from that and remain anonymous simply contact the maintainers.
