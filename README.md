# FindYourYoutuber
This is a algorithm that will find the Youtuber that you might want to watch
I made this to specifically focus on learning how to use Object Oriented Programming, but I also wanted to make a app that people could use world wide.

#Developer | how to work on it
To work on the product you should first download the source to your machine. Aftherwards, work on bugs that you find or improvements you want to add. REMEMBER that this version is non-gui. If you wish to work on the GUI version, I plan to release GUI Version 0.0.1 sometime in March or April. Once you made your contributions, submit your code via merge request. I will review code and heavily test it and mainly try and break your code.(How debugging works)  By doing this I will ensure your code is right for the project. If I deny your code please do not feel insulted, work on improving it and resubmit a merge reuqest.
