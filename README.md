#FindYourYoutuber Documentation 
FindYourYoutuber V0.0.1-Alpha is now released as of 7/24/2015. 

# User Guide 
First and foremost, we would like to thank you for taking the time to download our program, this was our d√©but program and we learned allot  about our mistakes, and  coding flaws. Is the code perfect? No, however, our goal since the beginning was for us to get our first project out.
 furthermore, taking two months to push the project shows we were dedicated to making it happen. So once again, thank you to anyone who took the time to download the project. 
 Sincerely, 
 Austin
 
 To install the program, you have two options, (only one if you don't use mac), the first option is to download the executable and run it, that is only if you run it on Windows. The Second option is to download the repo on your machine and run it, all you will need is python 2.7 for this. 
 If you have any problems do not hesitate to open a issues on Git hub, a developer will try their best to help you. 
 
 
 # Developers Guide
 Most of the original team has moved onto other projects, therefore, only Austin is making active updates to this program. We will appreciate any code that you might think will help the codebase. The only requirement is that you practice good coding skills. Also, please make contact with the current
 project maintainer before you code, please don't waste your time. This project does not have testing requirements because the original team was new to programming when making this project.
