#FindYourYoutuber Coming Soon! Version 0.0.2 Release Friday July 25th, by 2am | Status: On Track 
We would like to thank anyone who tested our closed beta of 0.0.2. Stable version 0.0.2 comes out friday.

We have been working hard to develop the new and most likely only version of Find_Your_Youtuber, this project was designed for us to learn software development techniques, and get familiarized with Github. However, we would love to see feedback on the project once completed.
