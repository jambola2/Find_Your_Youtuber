# FindYourYoutuber
This is a tool that will find the Youtuber that you might want to watch
I made this to specifically focus on learning how to use Object Oriented Programming, but I also wanted to make a app that people could use world wide. 
# Users 
Beta Testing can be done through .py You will need python 2.7 installed and basic knowledge of how to run a python program. Later on a .exe will be released for testing. 

# Developer 
The BETA 0.0.1 version of NON-GUI Find Your Youtuber will be released by Sunday, Febuary 28th, 2015. Furthermore, please be aware that the code might contain some bugs. I am not perfect, but this is your perfect time to work on bugs and submit merge request.
