#Development by the creator is on halt for the time being because of upcoming midterms. However, you can continue to push in merge request if you find something you want to work on. 

# FindYourYoutuber
This is a algorithm that will find the Youtuber that you might want to watch
I made this to specifically focus on learning how to use Object Oriented Programming, but I also wanted to make a app that people could use world wide. 
# Users 
Beta Testing can be done through .py You will need python 2.7 installed and basic knowledge of how to run a python program. Later on a .exe will be released for testing. 

# Developer 
The BETA 0.0.1 version of NON-GUI Find Your Youtuber will be released by Sunday, Febuary 28th, 2015. Furthermore, please be aware that the code might contain some bugs. I am not perfect, but this is your perfect time to work on bugs and submit merge request. We need to work on improving it as much as possible as I plan to release Find Your Youtuber Alpha Version 0.0.2 March 14th 2015. 

#Developer | how to work on it
To work on the product you should first download the source to your machine. Aftherwards, work on bugs that you find or improvements you want to add. REMEMBER that this version is non-gui. If you wish to work on the GUI version, I plan to release GUI Version 0.0.1 sometime in March or April. Once you made your contributions, submit your code via merge request. I will review code and heavily test it and mainly try and break your code.(How debugging works)  By doing this I will ensure your code is right for the project. If I deny your code please do not feel insulted, work on improving it and resubmit a merge reuqest. 

#Versions 
The way we do versions is through the type of improvement, we jump by 5 for a major improvement, we jump up 1 if its a simple, such as several bugs, and we jump by 1 in the first number if its a completly new version I.E Beta(0) to Alpha(1) to Stable(2) The intial version of this product will be 0.0.1

#Becoming a chairman on the releaser board
If you submit at least 15 bugs or improvements that are super impressive, I will consider making you a releaser. Essentially, it means you have proven yourself worthy to be able to review other peoples' code and merge them. As I am a college student, it might not always be possible for me to complete merge request in a timely manner. What the releaser board essentially does, is everyone on the board reviews merge requests and then submits a survey to merge or not merge.
