# FindYourYoutuber
V 0.0.1-Open Beta- Current stage of application. 
This is a simple quiz for someone to find a Youtuber.  as of right now, V 0.0.2 is planned to be released sometime in May. Once released, it should be availible in the Raspian Store, and we will also release it on SourceForge sometime after that. This program has a very simple command line gui, simply because the founder of this project was too lazy to build one. However, if you want to see a GUI for this project, we may entertain the idea. The founder of this application made it, half to get familarized with managing a Github Project, and half because he wants to make something for people to download. He is also working on many other projects, and will fix bugs when they arise and are reported, but he might not push updates quickly. Updates will rely solely on demand, so if you want more updates, you can either bug the founder, or submit merge requests. However, the founder does vow to push V 0.0.2 of this application. No gaurentees of V 0.0.3, that will solely rely on the amount of downloads it gets on Sourceforge and Raspbian.
